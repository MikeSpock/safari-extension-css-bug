# safari-extension-css-bug
Minimal showcase of a safari extension bug

 - Open this html in Safari
 - Add showcase.safariextension as a safari extension
 - It should show 2 red bars, the second one being added by content.js via the extension
 - The bug is that the bar added by the extension should be green as it's defined in content.css via the extension
